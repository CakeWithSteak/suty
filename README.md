# suty is a correct-by-construction type checker for a substructural type system

This repository accompanies my bachelor thesis, "Correct-by-construction Type Checking for Substructural Type Systems".

### Dependencies
suty was tested with Agda version 2.6.4.3 and standard library version 2.0. 

### Execution
`src/Everything.agda` contains some examples of using the type checker. These can be run with a single command using `make`.
